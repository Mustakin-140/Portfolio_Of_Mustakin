    <h1><u>Welcome to My University Life</u></h1>
    <p>
        I took admission at the Department of Computer Science & Engineering of Southeast University in the Spring 2020
        semester. I made a circle of people within a short time. But after the Mid term exam of 1st semester, the campus
        was shut down due to Covid-19 virus. So we started our university life virtually with online class, exam,
        presentation, viva.
    </p>
    <p>
        After 2 years, the on campus class started in Summer 2022 semester. We went back to the campus in a new normal
        life. Everything started in a new way. In January 2023, our university was shifted to the dreamy permanent
        campus at Tejgaon, at the heart of the Dhaka city. I completed my researh work under the supervision of Roksana
        Akter Madam, Assistant Professor, Department of CSE, Southeast University. My other team members were: Mohammad
        Shafiqur Rahman and Israt Jahan Juhi.
    </p>
    <p>I joined as Intern at the Office of the Information Technology (IT) of Southeast University on 25 February, 2024.
        Here I experienced so many things. I worked with seniors from my department. It was a nice, friendly
        environment. I worked as a Software Tester of the University Management System (UMS) of Southeasy University
        (SEU). I also did data collection, data entry, data formatting and data validation under the Supply Chain
        Management and Inventory System Project of the university. Overall it was a great experience of working here. My
        internship period ended on 30 June, 2024. My final result was published on 09 July, 2024 and then I became a
        graduate of this university. </p>

    <p>University life gave me lots of good memories and also tough times. My respected teachers were very helpful and
        motivated me with their valuable advices. I met some seniors who never behaved like a senior but like a friend.
        I also found some good and potential juniors who can do well in future. I had some good and helpful batchmates
        and friends. I was involved with various extra curricular activities. I was the Vice President and President of
        the Southeast Computer Club in 2022 and 2023 respectively. I have learned event management, time management,
        team work, leadership, communication skills. I found a good community here. So this is all about my university
        life. </p>
