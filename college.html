    <h1><u>Welcome to My College Life</u></h1>
    <p>My collage name is Shaheed Police Smrity College. It is situated in Mirpur, Dhaka. I got admitted here in 2017
        after passing SSC. I found some guys who were also from my SSC batch. I college life was not that much colorful.
        After my admission, my father became sick and hospitalized. During this tough time, I had to struggle a lot to
        continue my study. But by the Grace of Allah, I stood 10th position among all the boys and girls of Science
        group at the Half yearly exam. That was really unexpected from me. But after 8 days of result publishing, my
        father left us forever. It was a shocking event for me as we lost umbrella over us. </p>
    <p>After the departure of my father, I came back again to my study. I regained myself and focused on my life. Then
        HSC exam appeared. I sat for the exam and achieved GPA-4.75. Even though it was not a good grade point
        considering the whole country's result but still it was satisfactory for me and my family. Then I started to
        take my preparation for the public university admission test. I did not do too bad there. But due to low GPA I
        could not get good position for desired subjects. Thus I was unable to get admission in any public university.
        In this part, I have discussed my college life along with the admission test journey. </p>
